        <h1>The side-project that evolved</h1>
        <p>
            As a student, money is always tight. It was always hard for me to keep track of my finances.
            I was always aware that there were tools out there, that could help me with that...<br>
        </p>
        <p class="py-2 mt-0 text-center italic font-bold text-2xl">
            But I'm a DEVELOPER! I can do that myself!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, at the end of 2022, I started working on a tool to help me keep track of my finances.
            It was a simple web-app, that allowed me to keep track of my expenses and income. It was a simple CRUD app,
            that allowed me to add, edit and delete transactions.<br>
            The project got very usefull very fast. I was able to keep track of my finances and see where my money went.
            I was able to add recurring transactions, like rent or my netflix abo.<br>
            By tagging individual transactions, I was able to group them and see how much money I spent on certain things.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was very happy with the result but it had one big flaw: I had to add every transaction manually.
            This was very time consuming and I often forgot to add transactions. So I decided to add a feature, that would
            allow me to import transactions from my bank account. By using the gocardless API, I was able to import transactions
            from my bank account. This was a huge improvement, because I did not have to add transactions manually anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the time I added more and more features and at the current point, I am very proud of what I have achieved.
